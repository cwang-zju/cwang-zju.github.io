I used to be an angler around the Chesapeake Bay area, along the Elizabeth River. The addiction of saltwater fishing is like when you are doing research - "you don't know what you're gonna catch", the unpredictable spinning of the reel and the exictment of fighting, especially with the big fish. Happy to share some pics:
